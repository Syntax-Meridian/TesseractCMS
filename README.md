# TesseractCMS - Lightweight and customizable websites system

TesseractCMS aims to be a novel approach to content management systems (CMS), incorporating features that make it distinct from existing solutions like WordPress. This project is born out of a passion for learning and the desire to bring innovation to the CMS space.

## Project Philosophy

While TesseractCMS is primarily a learning project, we're treating it with the seriousness of a commercial venture. This means we're invested in researching, planning, and iterating based on feedback—even though our primary goal is fun and education, not profit.

## Core Features

### Strong Core Offerings

- **E-Commerce Integration**: Instead of relying on countless plugins, we intend to provide robust built-in e-commerce functionalities. Initial plans include integrating with platforms like Square or PayPal.
  
- **Improved Theming System**: A CSS theme system that offers an enhanced level of customization, aiming to be more intuitive and user-friendly than what's available in WordPress.

- **Multilingual Support**: An integrated multilingual system that enables content creators to write articles in multiple languages. The CMS will then display the appropriate language based on the user's browser settings.

- **Lightweight and Database-Free**: One of our primary goals is to avoid the bloat commonly associated with other CMSs. By making strategic choices in our feature offerings and focusing on performance, we aim to remain lightweight. 

## Roadmap

Our roadmap is fluid, and while we aim to implement all features, some might be adapted, delayed, or even dropped based on practicality, feasibility, and feedback.

1. Design the core architecture.
2. Explore and implement flat-file / SQLite database alternatives.
3. Develop the theming system.
4. Add multilingual support.
5. Implement e-commerce integrations (starting with Square or PayPal).
6. Ensure robust security, especially around e-commerce features.
